# A weekend app

## Where am I?

Sometimes it happens so that you you have a desire to create something, an app. Or contribute. But not always you know what exactly to work on. Here you are - a list of apps one can build in hours (depending on the choosen functionality of course ;)

Maybe you have an idea you would like to work on but have no time or knowledge? Share it (via a pull request to [this](https://github.com/BALEHOK/weekendapp) repository). Describe in details. Split in small deliverable chunks. See it being implemented by other enthusiasts.

## Applications

1. An application that lets you post your free app ideas that others can contribute to (this website implemented as a web app). [Read more](./a-weekend-app).
