# A weekend app

An application that lets you post your free app ideas that others can contribute to (this website implemented as a web app).

Suggested steps (you can choose, alter them, or stop at any step you want):

1. Create a simple HTML with a list of Application names and short description.
1. Add a JS framework of your choice so that the list is populated from an object rather hardcoded in HTML.
1. Create a detailed view (this page) where all the description and possible screenshots of the app are specified. Here you need to enchance the data model and add routing. Also it's time to think about project structure if you haven't done so yet.
1. Let users to add and edit entries.
1. Create an API server or use a cloud serverless architecture (eg. Amazon) to store the app list.
1. Create user permission system. Eg. only an administrator and the auathor of the idea can edit it.
1. Add comments and/or discussions to let people talk and collaborate.
1. Let people post links to their implemetations (great to have there a description, image and GitHub link).
1. Make the UI of the app beautiful.
